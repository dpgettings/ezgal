# To Do

#### Sort Term

* Write some unit tests! Or just any tests at all, really...

* Include install info in README

* Write script to download model files in addition to those included with repo



#### Medium Term

* Change `pyfits` to `astropy.fits`

* PEP8

* ~~General coding style improvements~~


#### Longer Term

* Register with Python Package Index. 

* Clean up inconsistent package usage (e.g. use of `array`, `math`, etc.)

* Make compatible with Python 3.x


## Feature Ideas

* Prettification of model specification interface

* Auto-downloading of models that are not found locally

* [And probably more...]
